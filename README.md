[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/21dc501c-7ab3-4a96-a230-be6812dad552/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/deluxe-griffin-ee110e/deploys)

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and deploy on Netlify for now.

### Installation

We use Yarn>=2

```
corepack enable
```

```
$ yarn install
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
